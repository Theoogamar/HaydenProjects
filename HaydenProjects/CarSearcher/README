This folder contains all the files for CarSearcher to work

facebookcookies.txt:
the first line contains account cookies used to access facebook
the second line contains the header "X_ASBD_ID" which is an ID generated by your browser

makemodel.json:
this file is generated on startup if the flag "GenerateMakeModelFile" is set to true

this files can be used to regenerate "makemodel.json" without needing to scrape again

marketplacekeys.json:
this file is auto-generated by the website

The resulting directory structure looks like this:
cef
facebookcookies.txt
