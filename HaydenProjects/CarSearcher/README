This folder contains all the files for CarSearcher to work

FbMarkerplaceCookie.json:
this file is initially made by you and then is updated by the server

makemodel.json:
this file is generated on startup if the flag "GenerateMakeModelFile" is set to true
this file is very cumbersome to generate and takes a few minutes
along with "makemodel.json" it also generates "carsale.json", "fbmarketplace.json"  and "gumtree.json"
this files can be used to regenerate "makemodel.json" without needing to scrape again

marketplacekeys.json:
this file is auto-generated by the website

X_ASBD_ID.txt:
this file contains the information need for the header "X_ASBD_ID.txt"
the data is generated by your browser and is paired with the "User-Agent" header
so make sure they're both generated by the same browser on the same machine

The resulting directory structure looks like this:
cef
FbMarkerplaceCookie.json
makemodel.json
marketplacekeys.json
X_ASBD_ID.txt
